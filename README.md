# instagram-bot-detector

An instagram farming bot detector, written in Python, using the random forest classifier to train the ML model. Contains a CLI to simply input username of a suspected farmbot account and return "[True]" if the account is a farm bot, and "[False]" if the account in question is not a farm bot account but used by an actual human for non influence farming purposes.

This project was submitted as a local hackathon entry. Our team won the third prize for this project.
